#Summary
This is an R Markdown document. For a Coursera project for Practical Machine Learning. The goal of this project is to predict and classify
the type of CLASS (A,B,C,D,E) on the record based on the training and test sets provided by the course project.In essence the predition will establish a pattern based on existing data and predict the CLASS for 20 records in a testing set. 

#Background notes Provided by the course Assisgnment
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement ??? a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

#Data 


The training data for this project was initially available here: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

# Initial Talking Point
This data has been downloaded by the developer in the working directory already.
The data attributes in the training set with values "NA" have already been analyzed and the list is prepared.


# The Sequence of this assisgnment
1. Load the Data Training and Test dataset from url
2. Cleaning Data for both "Training" and "Test"
  2a. Replace DIV/0 with NA
  2b. Remove near zero values and Nulls
3. Create Data Partition for "Training" set
  3a. Training
  3b. Valuation
4. PreProc, Train and Predict with Training set
5. Evaluate and Crossvalidate with valuation data.
6. Apply Test data and Predict

#Reproducible Code:
The list of libraries to be imported
```{r}
 library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rattle)
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
```


##Load Training and test set
THis loads the data and replaces any values with DIV by zero with NA

```{r, echo=FALSE}

training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", na.strings=c("#DIV/0!") )
test <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv", na.strings=c("#DIV/0!") )

```

##Cleaning the data
Removing Near Zero values and nulls from the training and test datasets, This set of null varibles were pre-analyzed. In addition to the null columns I  have removed  the first 7 columns that do not add any value for prediction and remove noise.

```{r,echo=TRUE}

mynulls <- names(training) %in% c("X","user_name","raw_timestamp_part_1","raw_timestamp_part_2","cvtd_timestamp","new_window","num_window","kurtosis_roll_belt","kurtosis_picth_belt","kurtosis_yaw_belt","skewness_roll_belt","skewness_roll_belt.1","skewness_yaw_belt","max_roll_belt","max_picth_belt","max_yaw_belt","min_roll_belt","min_pitch_belt","min_yaw_belt","amplitude_roll_belt","amplitude_pitch_belt","amplitude_yaw_belt","var_total_accel_belt","avg_roll_belt","stddev_roll_belt","var_roll_belt","avg_pitch_belt","stddev_pitch_belt","var_pitch_belt","avg_yaw_belt","stddev_yaw_belt","var_yaw_belt","var_accel_arm","avg_roll_arm","stddev_roll_arm","var_roll_arm","avg_pitch_arm","stddev_pitch_arm","var_pitch_arm","avg_yaw_arm","stddev_yaw_arm","var_yaw_arm","kurtosis_roll_arm","kurtosis_picth_arm","kurtosis_yaw_arm","skewness_roll_arm","skewness_pitch_arm","skewness_yaw_arm","max_roll_arm","max_picth_arm","max_yaw_arm","min_roll_arm","min_pitch_arm","min_yaw_arm","amplitude_roll_arm","amplitude_pitch_arm","amplitude_yaw_arm","kurtosis_roll_dumbbell","kurtosis_picth_dumbbell","kurtosis_yaw_dumbbell","skewness_roll_dumbbell","skewness_pitch_dumbbell","skewness_yaw_dumbbell","max_roll_dumbbell","max_picth_dumbbell","max_yaw_dumbbell","min_roll_dumbbell","min_pitch_dumbbell","min_yaw_dumbbell","amplitude_roll_dumbbell","amplitude_pitch_dumbbell","amplitude_yaw_dumbbell","var_accel_dumbbell","avg_roll_dumbbell","stddev_roll_dumbbell","var_roll_dumbbell","avg_pitch_dumbbell","stddev_pitch_dumbbell","var_pitch_dumbbell","avg_yaw_dumbbell","stddev_yaw_dumbbell","var_yaw_dumbbell","kurtosis_roll_forearm","kurtosis_picth_forearm","kurtosis_yaw_forearm","skewness_roll_forearm","skewness_pitch_forearm","skewness_yaw_forearm","max_roll_forearm","max_picth_forearm","max_yaw_forearm","min_roll_forearm","min_pitch_forearm","min_yaw_forearm","amplitude_roll_forearm","amplitude_pitch_forearm","amplitude_yaw_forearm","var_accel_forearm","avg_roll_forearm","stddev_roll_forearm","var_roll_forearm","avg_pitch_forearm","stddev_pitch_forearm","var_pitch_forearm","avg_yaw_forearm","stddev_yaw_forearm","var_yaw_forearm")

myTraining <- training[!mynulls]
myTest <- test[!mynulls]



```

##Creating data partition, I have taken 70% for "intrain" and the rest for the "valuation", We will drop "classe" column from our train set before preproc

```{r,echo=TRUE}
set.seed(123456)

inTrain <- createDataPartition(y = myTraining$classe, p = 0.7, list = F)
train <- myTraining[inTrain,]
valuation <- myTraining[-inTrain,]

numericreturnofremovedvalues <- function(x, classcolumn)
{
  indices <- -(which(names(x) %in% classcolumn))
  return (indices)
}

dropclasse <- names(train) %in% c("classe")

dropclasseP <- myTraining[!dropclasse]





```

##PreProc, Train and Predict with Training set

```{r,echo=TRUE}
preProc <- preProcess(train[, numericreturnofremovedvalues(train, c("classe"))], method="pca", pcaComp="30")

train_main <- predict(preProc, train[, numericreturnofremovedvalues(train, c("classe"))])

modfit <- randomForest(train$classe ~ ., data = train_main, ntree=200)

valid <- predict(preProc, valuation[, numericreturnofremovedvalues(valuation, c("classe"))])

prediction <- predict(modfit, valid)



```

## The requirement of the written assignement is to provide a crossvalidation and outofsampleerror, below are the three analysis for the three aspects
## Printing Confusion Matrix and crossvalidation and outofsampleerror

```{r,echo=TRUE}
print(confusionMatrix(prediction, valuation$classe), digits=4)

print(table(prediction, valuation$classe))

print(1 - (sum(diag(table(prediction, valuation$classe)))/ length(prediction)))

```

##Apply Test data and Predict

```{r,echo=TRUE}
FinalTest <- predict(preProc, myTest[, numericreturnofremovedvalues(myTest, c("problem_id"))])
myanswers <- predict(modfit, FinalTest)
myanswers

```

##Conclusion
Since the out of error value is `r 1 - (sum(diag(table(prediction, valuation$classe)))/ length(prediction))` which sugggests that the accuracy rate is close to 99%. I feel very confident using the randomforest ML process.

##Function to generate the files provided by Coursera

```{r,echo=TRUE}
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}

```

##Generating Files

```{r,echo=TRUE}
pml_write_files(myanswers)

```
